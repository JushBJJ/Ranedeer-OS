Version: Pre

Unfinished but decided to just release the first version fo it. For some reason CR_PRINTO function does not work but will fix that in the next release, CR_PRINTO function breaking causes other functions that print out to not work but printnum works for some reason. Weird. 

In the next update there will be:
	-Keyboard Input
	-Printo Fix
	-Color support
	-System calls
